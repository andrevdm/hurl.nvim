## Features

- üöÄ Execute HTTP requests directly from `.hurl` files.
- üëÅ‚Äçüó® Multiple display modes for API response: popup or split.
- üåà Highly customizable through settings.

## Usage

Add the following configuration to your Neovim setup with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "jellydn/hurl.nvim"
  dependencies = {"MunifTanjim/nui.nvim"},
  cmd = { "HurlRunner", "HurlRunnerAt", "HurlRunnerToEntry" },
  opts = {
    -- Show debugging info
    debug = false,
    -- Show response in popup or split
    mode = "split",
  },
  keys = {
    -- Run API request
    { "<leader>A", "<cmd>HurlRunner<CR>", desc = "Run All requests" },
    { "<leader>a", "<cmd>HurlRunnerAt<CR>", desc = "Run Api request" },
    { "<leader>te", "<cmd>HurlRunnerToEntry<CR>", desc = "Run Api request to entry" },
    -- Run Hurl request in visual mode
    { "<leader>h", ":HurlRunner<CR>", desc = "Hurl Runner", mode = "v" },
  },
}
```

Simple demo in split mode:

## Env File Support: vars.env

`hurl.nvim` seamlessly integrates with environment files named `vars.env` to manage environment variables for your HTTP requests. These environment variables are essential for customizing your requests with dynamic data such as API keys, base URLs, and other configuration values.


### Customization

You can specify the name of the environment file in your `hurl.nvim` configuration. By default, `hurl.nvim` looks for a file named `vars.env`, but you can customize this to any file name that fits your project's structure.

Here's how to set a custom environment file name in your `hurl.nvim` setup:

```lua
require('hurl').setup({
  -- Specify your custom environment file name here
  env_file = 'hurl.env',
  -- Other configuration options...
})
```

### File Location

The plugin looks for a `vars.env` file in the following directories:

- Current file's directory
- src/
- test/
- tests/
- server/
- src/tests/
- server/tests/

This makes it convenient to specify environment-specific variables that your HTTP requests may use.
## Demo

Check out the following demos to see `hurl.nvim` in action:

### Run a File

Run the entire file by pressing `<leader>A` or run `HurlRunner` command.

[![Run a file in popup mode](https://i.gyazo.com/e554e81788aad910848ff991c9369d7b.gif)](https://gyazo.com/e554e81788aad910848ff991c9369d7b)

### Run a Selection

Select a range of lines and press `<leader>h` to execute the request or run `HurlRunner` command.

[![Run a selection in popup mode](https://i.gyazo.com/1a44dbbf165006fb5744c8f10883bb69.gif)](https://gyazo.com/1a44dbbf165006fb5744c8f10883bb69)

### Run at current line

Place your cursor on the line you want to run and press `<leader>a` or run `HurlRunnerAt` command to execute the request. It need be one of the HTTP methods listed: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH.

[![Run at current line in popup mode](https://i.gyazo.com/20efd2cf3f73238bd57e79fc662208b1.gif)](https://gyazo.com/20efd2cf3f73238bd57e79fc662208b1)

### Run to entry

Place your cursor on the line you want to run to that entry and press `<leader>te` or run `HurlRunnerToEntry` command to execute the request. It need be one of the HTTP methods listed: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH.

[![Run to entry in split mode](https://i.gyazo.com/14d47adbfcab9e945f89e020b83328a9.gif)](https://gyazo.com/14d47adbfcab9e945f89e020b83328a9)

Note: it's running to that entry and ignore the remaining of the file. It is useful for debugging purposes.

## Default Key Mappings

`hurl.nvim` comes with some default key mappings to streamline your workflow:

- `q`: Close the current popup window.
- `<C-n>`: Switch to the next popup window.
- `<C-p>`: Switch to the previous popup window.

These key mappings are active within the popup windows that `hurl.nvim` displays.

## Configuration

`hurl.nvim` can be customized with the following default configurations:

```lua
local default_config = {
  -- Toggle debugging information
  debug = false, -- If true, logs will be saved at ~/.cache/nvim/hurl.nvim.log

  -- Set the display mode for the response: 'split' or 'popup'
  mode = 'split',
  -- Split settings
  split_position = "right"
  split_size = "50%",

  -- Popup settings
  popup_position = '50%',
  popup_size = {
    width = 80,
    height = 40
  },

  -- Default environment file name
  env_file = 'vars.env',

  -- Specify formatters for different response types
  formatters = {
    json = { 'jq' },  -- Uses jq to format JSON responses
    html = {
      'prettier',     -- Uses prettier to format HTML responses
      '--parser',
      'html',
    },
  },
}
```

To apply these configurations, include them in your Neovim setup like this:

```lua
require('hurl').setup({
  debug = true,          -- Enable to show detailed logs
  mode = 'popup',        -- Change to 'popup' to display responses in a popup window
  env_file = 'vars.env', -- Change this to use a different environment file name
  formatters = {
    json = { 'jq' },    -- Customize the JSON formatter command
    html = {
      'prettier',       -- Customize the HTML formatter command
      '--parser',
      'html',
    },
  },
})
```

Adjust the settings as per your needs to enhance your development experience with `hurl.nvim`.

### Tips
- Enable debug mode with `debug = true` for detailed logs. Logs are saved at `~/.cache/nvim/hurl.nvim.log` on macOS.
- **Split Mode with Edgy:** `hurl.nvim` can be used with [edgy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/edgy.nvim) to manage layout when using the split mode. 

```lua
right = {
  { title = "Hurl Nvim", ft = "hurl-nvim" }
}
```
