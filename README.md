</p>

## Features

- üöÄ Execute HTTP requests directly from `.hurl` files.
- üëÅ‚Äçüó® Multiple display modes for API response: popup or split.
- üåà Highly customizable through Neovim settings.

## Usage

Add the following configuration to your Neovim setup:

```lua
  {
    "jellydn/hurl.nvim",
    dependencies = { "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim" },
    cmd = { "HurlRunner", "HurlRunnerAt" },
    opts = {
      -- Show debugging info
      debug = false,
      -- Show response in popup or split
      mode = "popup",
    },
    keys = {
      -- Run API request
      { "<leader>A", "<cmd>HurlRunner<CR>", desc = "Run All requests" },
      { "<leader>a", "<cmd>HurlRunnerAt<CR>", desc = "Run Api request" },
      -- Run Hurl request in visual mode
      { "<leader>h", ":HurlRunner<CR>", desc = "Hurl Runner", mode = "v" },
    },
  },

## Env File Support: vars.env

`hurl.nvim` offers seamless integration with `vars.env` files to manage environment variables for your HTTP requests.

### File Location

The plugin looks for a `vars.env` file in the following directories:

- Current file's directory
- src/
- test/
- tests/
- server/
- src/tests/
- server/tests/

This makes it convenient to specify environment-specific variables that your HTTP requests may use.

## Default Key Mappings

`hurl.nvim` comes with some default key mappings to streamline your workflow:

- `q`: Close the current popup window.
- `<C-n>`: Switch to the next popup window.
- `<C-p>`: Switch to the previous popup window.

These key mappings are active within the popup windows that `hurl.nvim` displays.

## Tips

Enable debug mode with `debug = true` for detailed logs. Logs are saved at `~/.cache/nvim/hurl.nvim.log` on macOS.
