<h1 align="center">Welcome to hurl.nvim üëã</h1>
<p>
  <strong>Hurl.nvim</strong> is a Neovim plugin that brings the power of the Hurl command line tool into your editor. Designed to run HTTP requests from `.hurl` files, this plugin simplifies the API development process, making it both efficient and versatile.
</p>

## Features

- üöÄ Execute HTTP requests directly from `.hurl` files.
- üëÅ‚Äçüó® Multiple display modes for API response: popup or split.
- üåà Highly customizable through Neovim settings.

## Usage

Add the following configuration to your Neovim setup:

```lua
  {
    "jellydn/hurl.nvim",
    dependencies = { "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim" },
    cmd = { "HurlRunner", "HurlRunnerAt" },
    opts = {
      -- Show debugging info
      debug = false,
      -- Show response in popup or split
      mode = "popup",
    },
    keys = {
      -- Run API request
      { "<leader>A", "<cmd>HurlRunner<CR>", desc = "Run All requests" },
      { "<leader>a", "<cmd>HurlRunnerAt<CR>", desc = "Run Api request" },
      -- Run Hurl request in visual mode
      { "<leader>h", ":HurlRunner<CR>", desc = "Hurl Runner", mode = "v" },
    },
  }
}
```

## Env File Support: vars.env

hurl.nvim offers first-class support for environment files named vars.env. These files can manage environment variables that your HTTP requests may rely on.

### File Location

hurl.nvim looks for a `vars.env` file in the following directories by default:

- Current file's directory
- Project root directory
- src/
- test/
- tests/
- server/
- src/tests/
- server/tests/

## Default Key Mappings

`hurl.nvim` comes with some default key mappings to streamline your workflow:

- `q`: Close the current popup window.
- `<C-n>`: Switch to the next popup window.
- `<C-p>`: Switch to the previous popup window.

These key mappings are active within the popup windows that `hurl.nvim` displays.

## Tips

You could enable debug mode with `debug = true` in your configuration to see more information. All the logs will be printed in the `hurl.nvim.log` in Neovim cache folder. For instance, in MacOS, the log file is located at `~/.cache/nvim/hurl.nvim.log`.
