ENV FILE SUPPORT: VARS.ENV              *hurl.nvim-env-file-support:-vars.env*

`hurl.nvim` offers seamless integration with `vars.env` files to manage
environment variables for your HTTP requests.


FILE LOCATION ~

The plugin looks for a `vars.env` file in the following directories:

- Current file‚Äôs directory
- src/
- test/
- tests/
- server/
- src/tests/
- server/tests/

This makes it convenient to specify environment-specific variables that your
HTTP requests may use. ## Demo

Check out the following demos to see `hurl.nvim` in action:


RUN A FILE ~

Run the entire file by pressing `<leader>A` or run `HurlRunner` command.

RUN A SELECTION ~

`HurlRunner` command.

RUN AT CURRENT LINE ~

Place your cursor on the line you want to run and press `<leader>a` or run
`HurlRunnerAt` command to execute the request. It need be one of the HTTP
methods listed: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH.

DEFAULT KEY MAPPINGS                          *hurl.nvim-default-key-mappings*

`hurl.nvim` comes with some default key mappings to streamline your workflow:

- `q`: Close the current popup window.
- `<C-n>`: Switch to the next popup window.
- `<C-p>`: Switch to the previous popup window.

These key mappings are active within the popup windows that `hurl.nvim`
displays.


TIPS                                                          *hurl.nvim-tips*
